The task of machine translation presents numerous challenges, primarily arising from language ambiguity and variation. 

The motivation for the research was to evaluate the quality of translation performed by the pre-trained model (CTranslate); and to experiment and evaluate various prompting techniques for data augmentation done by LLM and translations done by MT model.  

The paper consists of a few chapters: "Related Work" (mentions where this research situates itself in the field of MT); "Dataset Description" where Data Statement (the curation rationale, text characteristics, and language varieties, etc.) is described: "Linguistic Analysis" introduces five linguistic phenomena in the Russian language and three main properties relevant to the five phenomena, these properties are essential for the subsequent task of machine translation; "Prompting with LLMs" describes various techniques used for the data augmentation and MT quality assessment. "Machine Translation Task" describes the experiments and results. Discussion review the Error Analysis of the MT. 

The research is based on the curated bilingual dataset of Russian and English sentences. In the dataset, Russian is the source language, and English is the target language.
